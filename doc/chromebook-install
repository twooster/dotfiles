For i3:

```
sudo apt-get install i3
sudo apt-get install xbacklight
sudo apt-get install xautolock
```

Disable power button:

```
sudo vim /etc/systemd/logind.conf
```

Change the commented-out line that reads `#HandlePowerKey=poweroff` to
read `HandlePowerKey=ignore`. Alternatively, look into (and potentially
write your own) systemd-keypress-inhibiting power manager thing. This
would probably be more portable in some ways.
